### Hello world! Moi maailma!

I am Satu, a student at [Hive Helsinki](https://hive.fi), a 42 coding school, and a software developer at Eficode in Helsinki.

So what's this 42? In addition to a bunch of Douglas Adams style jokes, the school is based on project-based peer-to-peer learning. Those fancy words simply mean that the curriculum is organized around projects that provide a practical way to introduce new topics. No books and no teachers means that we rely on each other and our own information-finding skills (read: Stack Overflow). Projects are validated via a series of evaluations done by our peers. The programming language of choice for the majority of the projects is C, aiming to give a comprehensive sense of the more low-level features of programming that are abstracted away in higher-level languages.

At Eficode, I work in the Managed Services' Application Management team.

Currently, I'm interested in
- cybersecurity, going through the [Cyber Security Base MOOC](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/) created by F-Secure and University of Helsinki
- self-hosted open source alternatives to different kinds of services from secret management to messaging platforms 

Projects I have recently worked on include
- [Corewar](https://www.github.com/juliuskoskela/corewar), the last project on the algorithms branch of the Hive curriculum. Around that, I got to study how programming languages are implemented, how compilers and interpreters work, and how to implement a simple lexer + parser and a VM to execute bytecode.
- [Lem-in](https://www.github.com/satukoskinen/lem_in), an algorithms project of the Hive curriculum. Topics included graph theory, finding a maximum flow in a network, and optimising the flow based on the project's objectives (which was to move a given number of ants through a network so that no ants collide in the process, ie. finding an optimal set of vertex disjoint paths between a source and a target vertex in a graph)
